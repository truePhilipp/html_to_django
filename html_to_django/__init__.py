"""
This package provides tools for converting special attributes in an HTML file to Django template tags.
It includes functions for converting individual files, as well as entire directories of files.
The conversion process involves parsing the HTML files, identifying special attributes,
and replacing them with Django template tags.

The package also includes a command line interface, which allows users to specify a file or directory to convert.
The command line interface supports an optional flag for overwriting the original HTML files
instead of creating new ones.
