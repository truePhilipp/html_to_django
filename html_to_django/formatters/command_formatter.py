"""
command_formatter.py

This module contains a function `format` that modifies a BeautifulSoup object in place.
The function searches for all elements with the attribute "dj-command". The value of "dj-command" is expected to be a
string representing a Django template command. For each found element, it replaces the element's content with the Django
template command, using the value of "dj-command" as the command. Then it removes the element's original tag, leaving
only the Django template command.

Example:
    If an element is <div dj-command="url 'index'"></div>,
    after processing, it becomes {% url 'index' %}.
