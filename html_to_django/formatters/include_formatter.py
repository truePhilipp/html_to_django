"""
include_formatter.py

This module contains a function `format` that modifies a BeautifulSoup object in place.
The function searches for all elements with the attribute "dj-include". The value of "dj-include" is expected to be a
string representing a Django template include command. For each found element, it replaces the element's content with
the Django template include command, using the value of "dj-include" as the command.
Then it removes the "dj-include" attribute from the element.

Example:
    If an element is <div dj-include="template_name.html"></div>,
    after processing, it becomes {% include "template_name.html" %}.
